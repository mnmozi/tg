# Terragrunt Repository

Welcome to my Terragrunt repository! ðŸš€

This repository serves as a collection of **modules** for various resources that I have previously used in my projects. These modules are designed to simplify the process of recreating or automating infrastructure by leveraging the power of Terragrunt.

## Features

- **Reusable Modules**: Modular design to manage resources efficiently.
- **Automation-Friendly**: Supports YAML configuration for automation (to be added soon).
- **Sample Configurations**: Includes example setups for quick starts and reference.
